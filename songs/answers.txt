We can calculate the aura by looking at the average of all songs:
"SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;"

Since there are already 100 songs there's no need to LIMIT them;

Based on the results, I can tell that the person enjoys dancing,
has a preference for energetic songs, and about half the time listens to positives music.
